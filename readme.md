# Assistant Aura

![Welcome to Aura](/img/onboarding.jpeg)

This started as [an attempt to reimplement Claude's computer use but with Gemini](https://alfredlua.substack.com/p/alfred-intelligence-3-building-an) but has evolved into a multi-agent assistant who can visit websites and summarize information.

Updates:

- 20/1/2025: I split the assistant into four agents: Orchestrator, Plan Critic, Researcher, and Planner (to learn about creating multi-agent systems). 
- 17/1/2025: I added support for Claude 3 Haiku (to keep cost low). For updates from here and earlier, see the [`single-agent` branch](https://github.com/alfredlua/assistant-aura/tree/single-agent). 
- 14/1/2025: I created a basic terminal-based chat app that can visit websites (and websites within websites) and summarize them. It has several tools: visit a URL, scrape a URL with Beautiful Soup into a temp file, parse a file with an LLM, and take a screenshot. It uses Gemini 1.5 Flash (because it's free).

## What it can do (for now)

![Test example](/img/example.jpeg)

Upon receiving a task, it can visit websites (and websites within websites) and summarize them. 

For "summarize the top post on hn", it returned:

>This post details reverse engineering the Bambu Connect Electron app, highlighting its inherent insecurity due to relying on security through obscurity. The instructions involve extracting the app's main.js file, fixing an asar archive, and using Ghidra to locate and extract a private key. Finally, the post provides a Python script to further deobfuscate and extract certificates and the private key from the app. [https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/wiki/Reverse_Engineering_Bambu_Connect](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/wiki/Reverse_Engineering_Bambu_Connect)

## How it works

This AI assistant consists of four agents:

1. **Orchestrator:** This agent comes up with the plan for the task, coordinates the work with the various agents, and updates the plan if necessary.
2. **Plan Critic:** This agent evaluates the plan by the Orchestrator and suggests improvements, up to three times.
3. **Researcher:** This agent has tools to scrape the source code of a website and save it to a file (temp/working_memory.txt).
4. **Parser:** This agent has a tool to extract information from temp/working_memory.txt using an LLM.

Hereâ€™s a rough flowchart of how the agents work together to complete a task:

## Issues

Well, it wouldn't be an app without issues. So, here goes:

- ~~It is lazy. If you ask it, "what's the first post on Hacker News?", it will only find the title of the post and guess what it is about. You have to specifically instruct it to visit the post. Oh, where's the AI that will replace me?~~ I updated the system prompt to make it less lazy.
- It doesn't work well with dynamically-loaded sites. I have added a function for scraping with Selenium but sites such as Reddit block Selenium.
- It does fail sometimes. Like humans, once it fails, it will sometimes be too demotivated to try again. But like all computer systems, you can turn it off and on and try again.
